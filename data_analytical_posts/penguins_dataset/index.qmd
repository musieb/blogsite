# Penguins Dataset

Let us import some libraries and load the penguins dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df_penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
df_penguins.head()
```
Let us look at the distribution of the body mass of the penguins by species.

```{python}
plt.title("Distribution of Body Mass of Penguins")
sns.kdeplot(x="body_mass_g", hue="species", data=df_penguins, fill=True);
```
Notice the distribution of the Gentoo penguins. It looks bimodal. One possible reason is a difference between male and females of that species. Let us look at the distribution of the body mass of that species by species and sex.

```{python}
plt.title("Distribution of Body Mass of Gentoo Penguins")
sns.kdeplot(x="body_mass_g", hue="sex", data=df_penguins[df_penguins["species"] == "Gentoo"], fill=True);
```

Indeed, the separation is by sex.
