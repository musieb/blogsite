This is a post on the tips dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df_tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
df_tips.head()
```

Let us plot visit counts by days of the week.

```{python}
plt.title("Visit Counts by Day of the Week")
sns.countplot(x="day", data=df_tips)
```

We can also examine the distribution of visit counts by day of the week and sex.
```{python}
plt.title("Visit Counts by Day of the Week")
sns.countplot(x="day", hue="sex", data=df_tips);
```

## Distribution of spending by gender

```{python}
plt.title("Distribution of Spending by Gender")
sns.kdeplot(x="total_bill", hue="sex", data=df_tips, fill=True);
```
